International Dates allows flexible date formatting in most languages of the world.

Date formatting begins with parsing the source date. International dates supports both formatted dates and natural language dates. Date parsing is done in the user selected locale among English (en), French (fr), German (de) and Dutch (nl). Note, upon installation, the selected locale will be the locale you selected in the general settings of Obsidian. For more details, visit [Date parsing](date-parsing.md).

Just select a date expression in your note, and activate one of the commands using the command palette
